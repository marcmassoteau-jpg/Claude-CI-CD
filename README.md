## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Claude Code Web access
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Setup Repository

1. **Fork or create this repository**

2. **Create the main branch** (IMPORTANT - do this first!)
   - If this is a new repository, you need to create a `main` branch first
   - You can do this by either:
     - Creating an initial commit and pushing to main, OR
     - Merging your first feature branch manually to create main
   - The automated PR creation will be skipped until main exists

3. **Enable GitHub Actions** in repository settings
   - Go to Settings > Actions > General
   - Allow all actions and reusable workflows

4. **Configure Workflow Permissions** (⚠️ CRITICAL - Required for PR creation!)

   Navigate to: **Settings > Actions > General**

   Scroll down to the **"Workflow permissions"** section:

   **Step A: Set Permission Level**
   - ⚪ Read repository contents and packages permissions (default)
   - 🔘 **Select: "Read and write permissions"** ← Click this radio button

   **Step B: Enable PR Creation**
   - ✅ **Check: "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** ← Must be checked!

   **Step C: Save**
   - Click **"Save"** button at the bottom

   ---

   **Visual Guide:**
   ```
   Workflow permissions
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ⚪ Read repository contents and packages permissions │
   │ 🔘 Read and write permissions            ← Select   │
   │                                                       │
   │ ✅ Allow GitHub Actions to create and    ← Check    │
   │    approve pull requests                             │
   │                                                       │
   │ [Save]                                   ← Click     │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

   **⚠️ Both settings are required:**
   - **"Read and write permissions"** - Allows workflow to push code and create issues
   - **"Allow GitHub Actions to create PRs"** - Specifically allows PR creation

   **Without these settings, you'll see errors like:**
   - ❌ "GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"
   - ❌ "Resource not accessible by integration"

   **Why these permissions are safe:**
   - Only applies to workflows in this repository
   - Workflows still require your explicit code in `.github/workflows/`
   - You control what the workflows can do
   - Standard practice for CI/CD automation

5. **Configure branch protection** (recommended)
   - Go to Settings > Branches
   - Add branch protection rule for `main`
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging

### Step 2: Using Claude Code Web (From Your Phone!)

1. **Access Claude Code Web**
   - Open your mobile browser
   - Navigate to Claude Code web interface
   - Authenticate with your account

2. **Connect to GitHub**
   ```
   Tell Claude: "Clone my repository [repository-url]"
   ```

3. **Make Changes**
   ```
   Tell Claude: "Add a new feature to display user statistics"
   ```

4. **Push to Feature Branch**
   ```
   Tell Claude: "Push these changes to a new feature branch"
   ```

   Claude will automatically:
   - Create a branch with naming convention: `claude/feature-name-sessionid`
   - Commit your changes
   - Push to GitHub

### Step 3: Automated CI/CD Pipeline

Once you push to a `claude/*` branch, GitHub Actions automatically:

#### 🔨 Build Phase
```yaml
- Checkout code
- Install Node.js dependencies (with caching)
- Run automated tests
- Generate detailed test summaries
- Upload test logs as artifacts (7-day retention)
```

#### 🐳 Docker Phase
```yaml
- Build Docker image with multi-stage optimization
- Tag with commit SHA and latest
- Run container health checks
- Capture runtime logs
- Save image as artifact (1-day retention)
- Generate Docker build summaries
```

#### 📝 PR Phase (Automatic - Only on Success)
```yaml
- Check if main branch exists
- Gather commit history and summary
- Create or update Pull Request to main
- Add detailed PR description with:
  * Commit count and list
  * All CI/CD status checks
  * Automated checklist
- Label with 'automated-pr' and 'claude-code'
```

#### 🐛 Failure Handling (Automatic)
If any build or test fails:
```yaml
- Collect all test and Docker logs
- Gather system information
- Create detailed GitHub Issue with:
  * Failure type (test/docker)
  * Complete error logs
  * Environment details
  * Debugging tips for Claude Code Web
  * Direct link to failed workflow run
- Update existing issue if one exists for the branch
- Provide Claude-friendly debugging instructions
```

### Step 4: Error Recovery with Claude Code Web

**If the build fails**, you'll automatically get a GitHub issue with:

1. **Complete Error Logs**
   - Test output (last 3000 chars)
   - Docker build logs
   - Container runtime logs

2. **Debugging Context**
   - Exact commit and branch that failed
   - System environment details
   - Direct link to workflow run

3. **Claude-Ready Instructions**
   - Simply share the issue with Claude Code Web
   - Ask: "Review this CI failure and fix it"
   - Claude will analyze logs and make fixes
   - Push fixes to the same branch
   - CI runs automatically again

**Example workflow:**
```
❌ Build fails → 🐛 Issue created → 📱 Tell Claude to fix it →
✅ Claude pushes fix → 🔄 CI runs again → ✅ Success → 📝 PR created
```

### Step 5: Review and Merge

1. **Review the automated PR**
   - Check test results in PR summary
   - Review code changes
   - Verify Docker build succeeded
   - See commit list and count

2. **Merge when ready**
   - Click "Merge Pull Request"
   - Automatic deployment triggers
   - Branch cleanup happens automatically

3. **Automatic Cleanup**
   - Feature branch is deleted immediately
   - Related CI failure issues are closed
   - Cleanup summary is generated

4. **Deployment**
   - Application deploys to production
   - Health checks verify deployment
   - Deployment summary with details
   - All artifacts are available

## 📱 Mobile Workflow Example

Here's a real example of using Claude Code Web from your phone:

### Scenario: Add a New Feature

**You (via phone):**
> "Claude, I want to add a new section to the homepage that shows the current build number and deployment time"

**Claude responds:**
> "I'll add that feature for you. Let me update the index.html file..."

**You:**
> "Great! Now push this to GitHub"

**Claude responds:**
> "I'll commit these changes and push to a new feature branch..."
>
> ✅ Created branch: `claude/add-build-info-a1b2c3d4`
> ✅ Committed changes
> ✅ Pushed to GitHub
>
> The CI/CD pipeline is now running. You can monitor it at:
> https://github.com/your-username/repo/actions

### What Happens Next (Automatically)

**Success Path:**
1. **Within 30 seconds**: Tests start running
2. **Within 2 minutes**: Docker build completes
3. **Within 3 minutes**: PR is automatically created with commit history
4. **You receive**: GitHub notification on your phone
5. **You review**: PR from your phone browser with all details
6. **You approve**: Tap "Merge Pull Request"
7. **Within 1 minute**: Feature branch automatically deleted
8. **Within 5 minutes**: Feature is live in production!

**Failure Path:**
1. **Within 30 seconds**: Tests or Docker build fails
2. **Within 1 minute**: Detailed GitHub issue is created automatically
3. **You receive**: Issue notification with complete error logs
4. **You ask Claude**: "Review issue #X and fix the failures"
5. **Claude analyzes**: Reads logs, identifies problem, makes fixes
6. **Claude pushes**: Fix to the same branch
7. **Within 2 minutes**: CI runs again automatically
8. **On success**: Issue is updated, PR is created
9. **After merge**: Issue automatically closed, branch deleted

## 🎓 Use Cases

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Branch Protection**
   - Require PR reviews before merging to main
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Restrict who can push to main

2. **Secrets Management**
   - Never commit secrets to repository
   - Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
   - Rotate credentials regularly

3. **Docker Security**
   - Use official base images
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities
   - Implement least privilege principle

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Automatic Issue Creation

**Good News!** When builds fail, the workflow automatically creates a detailed GitHub issue with:
- Complete error logs
- Environment information
- Direct links to failed workflow
- Claude-friendly debugging instructions

**To fix a failure:**
1. Check your GitHub Issues tab - there should be an auto-created issue
2. Open the issue and review the error logs
3. Tell Claude Code Web: "Review issue #X and fix the problems"
4. Claude will analyze the logs and push fixes
5. CI runs automatically on the same branch
6. When successful, the issue auto-closes

### Tests Failing

**Automatic:** Issue created with test logs

**Manual debugging:**
```bash
# Run locally to debug
npm install
npm test

# Check specific test
npm test -- --verbose
```

**Common fixes:**
- Update test assertions if business logic changed
- Check for missing dependencies
- Verify environment variables
- Review test timeout settings

### Docker Build Failing

**Automatic:** Issue created with Docker build logs

**Manual debugging:**
```bash
# Check Dockerfile syntax
docker build -t test .

# View detailed build logs
docker build --progress=plain -t test .

# Check for file access issues
ls -la
```

**Common fixes:**
- Verify Dockerfile syntax
- Check base image availability
- Ensure all files referenced exist
- Review .dockerignore file
- Check for network/registry issues

### Permission Error: "GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"

**Error message:**
```
pull request create failed: GraphQL: GitHub Actions is not permitted
to create or approve pull requests (createPullRequest)
```

**Root cause:** Workflow permissions are not properly configured.

**Solution - Configure BOTH settings:**

Navigate to: **Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions**

**✅ Step 1: Select "Read and write permissions"** (radio button)
- This gives the workflow basic write access

**✅ Step 2: Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** (checkbox)
- This specifically allows PR creation
- **This must be checked!** Many users miss this step

**✅ Step 3: Click "Save"**

**Visual reference:**

**Why both are needed:**
- Setting 1 (Read and write) = General permission level
- Setting 2 (Allow create PRs) = Specific PR creation permission
- **Both must be enabled** for the workflow to create PRs

**After fixing:**
1. Save the settings
2. Push a new commit to trigger the workflow
3. PR should be created automatically
4. Check Actions tab to verify success

**Still seeing errors?**
- Verify both checkboxes are set correctly
- Ensure Actions are enabled: Settings > Actions > General > "Allow all actions"
- Check workflow run logs for specific error messages
- See full setup guide in [Getting Started](#-getting-started) section

### PR Not Created Automatically

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Permission error** - See section above about workflow permissions
2. **Build failed** - Check for auto-created issue with details
3. **Main branch missing** - Workflow will skip PR creation with helpful message
4. **PR already exists** - Workflow updates existing PR instead
5. **Wrong branch name** - Must start with `claude/`

**Verification steps:**
```bash
# Check branch name
git branch

# Check workflow run
# Visit: https://github.com/your-username/repo/actions

# Check for existing PR
# Visit: https://github.com/your-username/repo/pulls
```

**Check workflow logs:**
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Click on "Create Pull Request" job
4. Look for error messages

### Branch Not Deleted After Merge

**Automatic cleanup should happen when:**
- PR is merged (not closed)
- Branch name starts with `claude/`
- Workflow has proper permissions

**Manual cleanup if needed:**
```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -d branch-name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

### Issue Not Auto-Closing After Merge

Issues are automatically closed when:
- Branch name in issue title matches merged branch
- Issue has `ci-failure` label
- PR was merged (not just closed)

Check issue labels and title if auto-close didn't work.
